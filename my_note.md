# some of my note might be helps you to take this course much more better

- before write code map out you want to do like thses .md file next to each file
- do baby steps don't build all program ad test build each step test it then go for next step
- if you have list of options don't write just if first , second put valid items in array and write condition if is not inside invalid show error
