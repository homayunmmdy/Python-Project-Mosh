# some of my note might be helps you to take this course much more better

- before write code map out you want to do like thses .md file next to each file
- do baby steps don't build all program ad test build each step test it then go for next step
- if you have list of options don't write just if first , second put valid items in array and write condition if is not inside invalid show error

## Refactoring 
changing the structure of the code without changin its functionality.

### Modularization
Breaking down a large program into samller resusable parts called modules or functions.

## DRY
Don't Repeat Yourself
for sitution that we have sencetive name and one typo mistake can lead to mistake store all of theme in one place to not repeat yourself and have one place to change in future 

## Don't use global value 
DOn't use global value as much as possible

## Function
each function you create is good to have only one and single responsiblity to do
