I took the [**Python Projects for Beginners**](https://codewithmosh.com/p/python-projects-for-beginners) course to strengthen my **problem-solving skills** through real-world coding challenges. Although I'm not a Python developer and only had a very basic understanding of the language when I started, this course helped me improve the way I approach programming problemsâ€”independent of the language.

### ðŸ“… Course Timeline

* **Started:** September 20, 2024
* **Completed:** October 7, 2024

### ðŸŽ¯ Why I Took This Course

My main goal was to learn how to break down complex problems and improve my logical thinking as a developer. This course stood out because it focuses less on just writing code and more on **how to think like a professional developer**. Through progressive, hands-on projects, I learned how to:

* Break problems into smaller, manageable steps
* Write cleaner, more efficient code
* Refactor and improve existing solutions
* Build coding confidenceâ€”even outside my primary tech stack

While I still consider myself a beginner in Python, the skills I developed during this course are applicable across languages and have improved how I approach challenges in any programming context.

### ðŸ“¢ Note on Course Access
Due to international sanctions in Iran, I was unable to access the official Code With Mosh platform directly. I obtained the course through a third-party distributor and completed it in full. While I do not have an official certificate, I carefully followed all course content and documented my learning here.

For courses that included hands-on projects, the completed work is available in this repository. For others that were more theory-focused, Iâ€™ve included comprehensive notes, summaries, and all relevant materials as evidence of completion and understanding.
